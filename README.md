## Usage

1. [**Install docker**](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)
1. **Download and start the owncloud server instance**  
`docker run --name oc -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -d l3iggs/owncloud`
1. **Access the owncloud setup page**  
Point your browser to:  
http://localhost/owncloud  
or  
https://localhost/owncloud  
and follow the on-onscreen instructions to finish the owncloud server setup.
1. **[Optional] Change your owncloud data storage location**  
On the Owncloud initial setup page, after setting up your admin account, instead of clicking the "Finish Setup" button, you can click "Storage & database" instead. You can change the data folder location here (note that this is a path inside the docker container, not on your host machine).  
It's likely desirable for owncloud's data storage to be placed in a persistant storage location outside the docker container, on the host's file system for example. Let's imagine you wish to store your docker files in a folder `~/ocfiles` on the host's file system. Then insert the following into the docker startup command (from step 2. above) between `run` and `--name`:  
`-v ~/ocfiles:/usr/share/webapps/owncloud/data`  
UID 33 or GID 33 (http in the container image) must have r/w permissions for `~/ocfiles` on the host system. Generally, it's enough to do:  
`chmod -R 770  ~/ocfiles; sudo chgrp -R 33  ~/ocfiles`  
[Read this if you run into permissions issues in the container.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24288616/permission-denied-on-accessing-host-directory-in-docker)
1. **[Optional] Change your owncloud config storage location**  
Similar to the above change, this allows the owncloud config directory to be stored outside of the docker container.  
`-v ~/occonfig:/etc/webapps/owncloud/config`  
`chmod -R g+rw  ~/occonfig; sudo chgrp -R 33  ~/occonfig`
1. **[Optional] Setup owncloud to use mariadb instead of the default sqlite database**  
On the Owncloud initial setup page, after setting up your admin account, instead of clicking the "Finish Setup" button, you can click "Storage & database" instead. Then click the "MySQL/MariaDB" enter 'root' in the Database user field and leave the password field blank. Choose any name you like for the Database name field. The Database host filed should be left as 'localhost' if you'd like to use the mariadb server provided in this docker image. You can get even fancier and direct owncloud to use a MySQL server outside of the docker image.
1. **[Optional] Use your own ssl certificate**  
This image comes with a self-generated ssl certificate and so you'll get browser warnings when you access owncloud via https. Know that currently the keys for this cert. are inspectable by anyone who wishes to. You can (and should, if you're concerned about security) replace the certificate provided here certificates with your own, properly generated cert. files:  
Assuming you have your own `server.crt` and `server.key` files in a directory `~/sslCert` on the host machine:   
`sudo chown -R root ~/sslCert; sudo chgrp -R root ~/sslCert`  
`sudo chmod 400 ~/sslCert/server.key`   
Then add `-v ~/sslCert:/https` to the docker run command line and you'll be using your own, private ssl certificate.  
1. **[Optional] Setup trusted domains**  
Accessing your owncloud server by pointing your web browser at http(s)://localhost/owncloud is fine, but maybe you've mapped the server to some hostname other than localhost. In order to access it via an address like http(s)://your.domain/owncloud you should add your.domain to ownCloud's list of trusted domains. To do that, after you've completed the setup from step 2 above, simply visit: `http://localhost/owncloud/index.php/settings/admin?trustDomain=your.domain`  
You'll get a message box asking you to verify the addition. After accepting that check, you should be able to access your owncloud server from http(s)://your.domain/owncloud (provided that you have the domain set up properly to point to the owncloud server in the docker container).
1. **[Optional] Stop the docker-owncloud server instance**  
`docker stop oc`
1. **[Optional] Delete the docker-owncloud server instance (after stopping it)**  
`docker rm oc`
1. **Profit.**
